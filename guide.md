title: The Jess Guide to L6ing

- It is your job to define your role. Eg “I am a software engineer working in security. My job is to build software tools which help security engineers get their work done more effectively.”
- Decide what should exist, how the system should work, and produce designs accordingly
- You need to get other people to work on your proposals. Align with their incentives - eg they are L3 and need to show substantial implementation work to get to L4, so give them an appropriately sized piece of work. Pretend you’re their manager (a good manager who is trying to progress their career). Know where they are in their level, incentivise them based on their career trajectory. Eg they don’t have too many docs so ask them to write one
- Hand out peer bonuses to everyone who you want to work with 
- At L5, you can be given problems and independently produce the solution. At L6, you need to define the problem itself and then outline the solution, while largely delegating the implementation to others.
- You need to strike a balance between understanding what you’re working on and not getting bogged down in the detail. People from academic backgrounds tend towards the latter. You need to get good at gathering enough context to make a decision or start implementing, and then stop investigating and do the work.
- The most important part of your design doc is the “alternatives considered” section, where you demonstrate your breadth of thought to reviewers and promo committees. The first option should be “do nothing” - if you can’t justify why your approach is better than nothing then don’t do it!
